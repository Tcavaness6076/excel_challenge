# Excel-Challenge

# Overview
The Excel-Challenge called for the use of excel functions such as pivot tables, pivo charts, column creation, column splitting and percentile based color coding to process crowdfunding data. In color coding the data, four outcome categorizes were created; 'Successful', "Failed", "Live" or "Canceled" to determine the overall success of a crwodfunding. We then created and split "Category" and "Sub-Category" columns to enable our ability to dtermine the largest category of crowdfunding and percentages of the four categorized outcomes.
